# Stock-Price-prediction Using Stacked LSTM
Overview:
1. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to predicting stock prices using stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
2. LSTM networks are well-suited for modeling sequential data like time series, making them a popular choice for stock price prediction tasks.
3. By stacking multiple LSTM layers, the model can capture complex temporal dependencies in the data, potentially leading to more accurate predictions.

Steps include:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from the raw data, such as moving averages, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), and sentiment analysis from news articles or social media.
3. Model Architecture Design:
  Construct a stacked LSTM neural network architecture:
  Multiple LSTM layers stacked on top of each other to capture complex patterns.
  Additional layers such as Dense layers for the final output and dropout layers for regularization.
  Define the output layer, typically a single neuron for regression tasks predicting the next stock price.
4. Training:
  Train the stacked LSTM model on the training data.
  Use backpropagation through time (BPTT) to update the model's weights and biases iteratively.
  Monitor training loss and validation loss to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
  Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of LSTM layers, and dropout rates to optimize the model's performance.
6. Evaluation:
  Evaluate the trained model on the test set using evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  Compare the model's predictions with actual stock prices to assess its accuracy and reliability.
7. Model Deployment:
  Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to make real-time predictions on new, unseen data.
  Implement a robust monitoring system to track model performance and update it periodically as new data becomes available.
